# Golden Sun: Djinn Guide

A guide for finding all djinn and summons in the *Golden Sun* video game series.

## Overview

The website will be a mix of Django and React. The website will show data but not take any in from users.
The use of React will make the website more interactive, and the use of Django will allow us to store and retrieve data in a database.

Each game in the *Golden Sun* series will have their own page, and there will be a main page to toggle between the three.
Within each page, the djinn and summons will be separated into "parts", referencing when in the game they can be obtained.

### Goals

* Create a website that combines Django (back-end) and React (front-end) into a single website.
* Create a guide to find certain items in three different games.
* Deploy a website that requires a program to be run, rather than using just index.html to build a website.

### Non-Goals

* This website does not act as a walkthrough, but a guide for specific items found in each game.
* This website will only tell the locations of djinn and summons, not show.
